GAP: Generic Access Profile:
    - How BLE devices from connections with each other
    Roles for devices:
        - Broadcaster: sending avertising events (e.g ble thermometer)
        - Observer: device that scans for nearby advertising devices. Can only observe data from nearby devices.
        - Central: can initiate and start connection process, known as master.
        - Peripheral: device that advertises and once connected with central, cannot make connections with other stations until connection with central is concluded.
    
GATT: Generic Attribute Profile 
    - Data exchange in BLE 
        - Needs connection to have bidirectional data transfer between two devices.
        - Need to have gone through the adversement process which is governed by GAP.
    ATT: Attributes Protocols
    Roles Heirarchy:
    - Peripheral: Known as the GATT Server, holds ATT look up data & definitions of services & chararcteristics
    - GATT Client: sends requests to server to access data, ble devices can act as a server and client at the same time. 
    - Profile: does not exist on the ble peripheral itself, simply a predefiend collection of services.
    - Service: a collection of chunks of data called characteristics.
        - each service has UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
        - UUID is a unique label which allows to access a particular service.
        - UUID can be 16 bit (official)/ 128 bit (custom)
    - Characteristic: a single data point of value
        - can hold x,y,z value of 3 axis accelerometer for example.
        - also have a predifined UUID 16/128 bit
